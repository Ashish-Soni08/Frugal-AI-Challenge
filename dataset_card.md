# [Frugal-AI-Challenge](https://frugalaichallenge.org/)

## Goal

To encourage both academic and industry actors to keep `efficiency` in mind when deploying **AI** models.

## The Challenges

By tracking both `energy consumption` and `performance` for different **AI** for `climate` tasks, we can incentive **frugality** in AI deployment while also addressing real-world challenges.

We have chosen *three* tasks across *three* modalities, all of which are useful in the `global fight` against the `climate crisis`:

- **Detecting Climate Disinformation**
- **Classifying regions at risk of wildfires**
- **Detecting Illegal Deforestation**

We will evaluate both `performance` and `efficiency` on each of the datasets, based on the real-world constraints of each `task` and the `energy` used.

The datasets for each task are hosted on the [Hugging Face organization page](https://huggingface.co/collections/frugal-ai-challenge/frugal-ai-challenge-tasks-673dd5ee724c6659a5b42443) - you can download them and start training models!

## CHOSEN TASK: üìù Detecting climate disinformation üìù: based on text from news articles

A major problem is the rise of climate related disinformation. A recent [scientific article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50591-6) estimated that **`14.8%`** of Americans do not believe in anthropogenic climate change. Much of this is probably due to disinformation. With climate change being one of the central threats to the wellbeing of our societies, this is a problem that must urgently be addressed.

Therefore, the task is to **Detect the Climate Disinformation in Newspaper articles.**

## Dataset

### Dataset Summary

A comprehensive collection of **~6000** `climate-related quotes and statements`, specifically `focused on identifying and categorizing climate disinformation narratives`. The dataset combines quotes and statements from various media sources, including television, radio, and online platforms, to help train models that can identify different types of climate disinformation claims. The labels are drawn from a simplified version of the [CARDS taxonomy](https://cardsclimate.com/) with only the **7** main labels.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation and Annotation

This dataset was compiled to help identify and understand common climate disinformation narratives in media and public discourse. **`It serves as a tool for training models that can automatically detect and categorize climate disinformation claims.`**

The dataset combines data from two main sources curated by the QuotaClimat & Data For Good team.

1. [DeSmog](https://www.desmog.com/climate-disinformation-database/) climate disinformation database with extracted and annotated quotes with GPT4o-mini and manual validations

2. [FLICC dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fzanartu/FLICCdataset) from the paper ["Detecting Fallacies in Climate Misinformation: A Technocognitive Approach to Identifying Misleading Argumentation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08254) by Francisco Zanartu, John Cook, Markus Wagner, Julian Garcia - re-annotated with GPT4o-mini and manual validations.

## Personal and Sensitive Information

The dataset contains publicly available statements and quotes. Care has been taken to focus on the claims themselves rather than personal information about individuals.

## Data Exploration

### Example Data Point

Here is an example data point from the dataset:

```json
{
    "__index_level_0__": 1109,
    "id": null,
    "label": "0_not_relevant",
    "language": "en",
    "quote": "Interesting to note that Oklahoma minimum temperatures in 2011 were in the bottom ten, including the coldest Oklahoma temperature ever recorded, -31F on February 10, 2011.",
    "source": "FLICC",
    "subsource": "CARDS",
    "url": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/fzanartu/FLICCdataset"
}
```

### Source Distribution

The dataset contains quotes from two main sources with the following distribution:

- **Desmog**: 4295 quotes
- **FLICC**: 1796 quotes

        "quote": "Hubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change Here‚Äôs what many people believe One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long we like Each of these presumptions‚Äîtogether, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate‚Äîis either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless Yes, it‚Äôs true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, ‚ÄòI do not think ‚ÄúThe Science‚Äù says what you think it says. For example, government reports state clearly that heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900 Hurricane activity is no different than it was a century ago Floods have not increased across the globe over more than seventy years Greenland‚Äôs ice sheet isn‚Äôt shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago Why aren‚Äôt these reassuring facts better known Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media And from a media perspective, fear sells ‚ÄòThings aren‚Äôt that bad‚Äô doesn‚Äôt sell Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data‚Äîthe hard science‚Äîfrom the US government and UN Climate reports say is that‚Ä¶ ‚Äòthings aren‚Äôt that bad. Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are ‚Äújust physics‚Äù either doesn‚Äôt understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know: I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models Let‚Äôs just take one simple, but significant assumption modelers must make: the impact of clouds on the climate Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can‚Äôt. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That‚Äôs a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world‚Äôs economy By the way, creating more accurate models isn‚Äôt getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to ‚Äòclimate change.‚Äô Yes, we‚Äôve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow ‚Äòclimate change‚Äô is making everything ‚Äòworse. Even if that were true, isn‚Äôt the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that ‚Äòworse‚Äô is not exactly a scientific term And how would we make it better For the alarmists, that‚Äôs easy: we get rid of fossil fuels Not only is this impractical‚Äîwe get over 80% of the world‚Äôs energy from fossil fuels‚Äîit‚Äôs not scientifically possible. That‚Äôs because CO2 doesn‚Äôt disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years In other words, it takes centuries for the excess carbon dioxide to vanish from the atmosphere. So, any partial reductions in CO2 emissions would only slow the increase in human influences‚Äînot prevent it, let alone reverse it CO2 is not a knob that we can just turn down to fix everything. We don‚Äôt have that ability. To think that we do is‚Ä¶ hubris Hubris leads to bad decisions A little humility and a little knowledge would lead to better ones I‚Äôm Steve Koonin, former Undersecretary for Science in the Obama Administration, and author of Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn‚Äôt, and Why It Matters, for Prager University.",
