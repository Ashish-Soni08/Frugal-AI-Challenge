# [Frugal-AI-Challenge](https://frugalaichallenge.org/)

## Goal

To encourage both academic and industry actors to keep `efficiency` in mind when deploying **AI** models. 

## The Challenges

By tracking both `energy consumption` and `performance` for different **AI** for `climate` tasks, we can incentive **frugality** in AI deployment while also addressing real-world challenges.

We have chosen *three* tasks across *three* modalities, all of which are useful in the `global fight` against the `climate crisis`:

- **Detecting Climate Disinformation**
- **Classifying regions at risk of wildfires**
- **Detecting Illegal Deforestation**

We will evaluate both `performance` and `efficiency` on each of the datasets, based on the real-world constraints of each `task` and the `energy` used.

The datasets for each task are hosted on the [Hugging Face organization page](https://huggingface.co/collections/frugal-ai-challenge/frugal-ai-challenge-tasks-673dd5ee724c6659a5b42443) - you can download them and start training models!



## Environment Setup

```bash
python -V
# Output: Python 3.12.1
```

```bash
# create a environment named -> samba-ai
python -m venv frugal-ai
```

```bash
# activate the environment
source frugal-ai/bin/activate
```

```bash
# deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

```bash
# create a Jupyter Notebook kernel
pip install jupyter ipykernel
```

```bash
# add the virtual environment as a kernel for the jupyter notebook
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=frugal-ai --display-name="Py3.12-frugal-ai"
```

```bash
# verify kernel installation
jupyter kernelspec list
```

```bash
# If needed
jupyter kernelspec uninstall frugal-ai
```

```bash
# A python package estimating the hardware energy consumption (CPU + GPU + RAM) of your program.

pip install codecarbon
```

## CHOSEN TASK: üìù Detecting climate disinformation üìù: based on text from news articles

A major problem is the rise of climate related disinformation. A recent [scientific article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50591-6) estimated that **`14.8%`** of Americans do not believe in anthropogenic climate change. Much of this is probably due to disinformation. With climate change being one of the central threats to the wellbeing of our societies, this is a problem that must urgently be addressed.

Therefore, the task is to **Detect the Climate Disinformation in Newspaper articles.**

## Dataset

### Dataset Summary

A comprehensive collection of **~6000** `climate-related quotes and statements`, specifically `focused on identifying and categorizing climate disinformation narratives`. The dataset combines quotes and statements from various media sources, including television, radio, and online platforms, to help train models that can identify different types of climate disinformation claims. The labels are drawn from a simplified version of the [CARDS taxonomy](https://cardsclimate.com/) with only the **7** main labels.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation and Annotation

This dataset was compiled to help identify and understand common climate disinformation narratives in media and public discourse. **`It serves as a tool for training models that can automatically detect and categorize climate disinformation claims.`**

The dataset combines data from two main sources curated by the QuotaClimat & Data For Good team.

1. [DeSmog](https://www.desmog.com/climate-disinformation-database/) climate disinformation database with extracted and annotated quotes with GPT4o-mini and manual validations

2. [FLICC dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fzanartu/FLICCdataset) from the paper ["Detecting Fallacies in Climate Misinformation: A Technocognitive Approach to Identifying Misleading Argumentation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08254) by Francisco Zanartu, John Cook, Markus Wagner, Julian Garcia - re-annotated with GPT4o-mini and manual validations.
